# Objective of the Game
The main objective is to sink all of the opponent’s ships before they sink yours. Each player has a fleet of ships that they place on a board in secret.

# Game Components
Boards: Each player has two 10x10 grids. One to place their own ships and another to record shots against the opponent’s fleet.
Ships: Each player has a fleet that generally includes an aircraft carrier, a battleship, a submarine, a destroyer, and a patrol boat.
Markers: Used to record hits and misses.
# How to Play
Placing Ships: Each player places their ships on their board in secret.
Turns: Players take turns firing at coordinates on the opponent’s board. For example, a player might say “B5” to fire at that square.
Hits and Misses: If the shot hits a ship, the opponent must say “Hit”. If the shot sinks the ship, they must say “Sunk”. If the shot misses, they must say “Miss”.
Recording: Each player records their shots on the firing board, using markers to indicate hits and misses.
End of the Game
The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent’s ships.
